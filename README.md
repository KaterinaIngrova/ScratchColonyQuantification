# ScratchColonyQuantification
This repository comprises MATLAB functions designed for the quantitative analysis of data derived from Scratch assay and Colony formation assay experiments. Scratch assay and Colony formation assay are widely used experimental techniques for studying cell migration and colony formation.

Scratch_function.m
 - Function for analyzing data from Scratch assay experiments
 - Calculates metrics such as average scratch width in micrometers and scratch area in mm2
  
Colony_function.m
 - Function for analyzing data from colony formation assay experiments
 - Provides data on the number of colonies and the area of the well covered by colonies in cm2
